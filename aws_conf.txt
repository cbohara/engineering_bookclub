How Amazon leverages AWS to deliver analytics at enterprise scale

Project Andes
Amazon.com analytics transition from Oracle DW > AWS

ELT = pure SQL statements
(only) had to migrate 1M SQL queries
didn't have to worry about other programming languages in the ecosystem

limited the scope to only structured data + users can query via SQL

EMR allows you to decouple storage + compute = ideal
Redshift = still coupled compute + storaged
however Redshift allows easy querying via SQL

store all data in S3
add layer (catalogue) on top of S3
replicate database like experience

allow users ability to transform/join datasets 

synchronized metadata
built subscription service that would activate ETL based on updates

redshift spectrum = glue + redshift

how to get people off a legacy system on to a new system
standup replica of the warehouse
allow users to manage their own migration strategy timeline

schema conversion tool from AWS
automated query conversion from Oracle to Redshift SQL syntax 

Andes metadata service
any time data changed > synchronize downstream jobs
completion service = track if a job is done
manifests = abstract away file updates to optimize for later reads
audit logging for changes

subscription service
contract = publisher determined governance + SLAs
synchronization = updates data/metadata/schema

synchronizer targets
1. Redshift
2. AWS Glue catalog
fully decoupled storage + compute
3. Redshift spectrum 
launched halfway through migration
turns fully coupled + compute into semi-coupled  
run query against S3 as if running on local Redshift cluster
gained significant new functionality with minimal investment

need to be ready when working in the AWS environment to always update technology

Andes user experience
give full metadata via UI
provide data completness updates
provide schema attributes
enable user to subscribe to a dataset

migration context
Amazon.com does not stop
make sure users have necessary training 

running 2 systems in parallel is super expensive
move users from old system to new system as fast as possible

need to transition 80K users
over-communicate often

Andes has been taking the full analytics workload for Amazon.com for the past 12 months

leverage data migration service (DMS) + schema conversation tool (SCT)

We Power Tech - In Diversity + Inclusion, Details Matter
##############

data in diversity + inclusion
ask HR to keep metrics beyond recruitment
keep metrics at a team level

ex: data around how long a population is at a certain level (1 vs 2 vs senior vs staff)
how quickly do they rise up the ranks?

rates of women in CS degrees has decreased(?!)
half of women are likely to leave the field within the first 7 years

bias training is not effective
you can't change a company culture by doing anything once

what can you do to change things?
listen to what other people are staying
apply compassion
hold people accountable 
bias interuptor tool for reviews
