Learning Data Governance
central goal = data quality

data managment = using data to make good business decision
data governance = using disciplined behavior across entire org on how we manage that data

central principles:
transparency
- clearly understand
- avoid surprises 
- gain buy in 
- gain trust
- why things are being done and the value of those processes

accountability
- hold people accountable to take specific actions on specific times

standardization
- how data is labeled, described, and catagorized*
- ex: use CA or California?
- makes data more valuable when can be joined across multiple systems

specific core focus areas:
policy - set of guidelines by a governing body to achieve goals
quality - does the integrity of the data give us the confidence to plan + make business decisions?
compliance - ensuring our data is handled in a way to adhere to regulations
business intelligence - how we discover + manage insights, manage access to those who want to make insights

why?
competitive advantage - leveraging insights in data > win in the marketplace
compliance
- management oversight
- risk management
- accountability
- timeliness
- enforcement

common mistake - who owns the data?
data stewards
- individual or team who is responsible for data governance
- create rules + processes for governing data
- different people than data owners 

why is it important to assign ownership to data?
- care about the data they have been entrusted
- accountable to an authority that has an enterprise perspective

data stewards help with
- agree upon data policy + procedures 
- resolving data challenges
- reviewing concerns

data management maturity model
scale
0 = no maturity
5 = optimized
rank current + monitor regularly

categories
1. data strategy - formally articulated plan, reviewed + endorsed by leadership team
2. data management - regular backups, only appropriate ppl can access, audit access
3. data quality - accurate, up to date, complete, appropriate data for use case (fitness)
4. data operations - lifecycle of data, process for how data enters + exits, data security, disaster recovery
5. data platforms - technology architecture focus
6. data support - metrics, analysis capabilties, risk management, configuration management

managing + maintaining new processes is difficult to implement
- ensure program is documented + easy to understand
- documentation should reflect processes that have buy in from stakeholders
 
process

- managing change - ex: handle new regulation?
- resolving issues - deal with complex issues - how will they be surfaced and resolved?
- communications - doesn't happen by accident, need to communicated to relevant stakeholders
- reporting value - must report the value of the program, frequently ask if the program is providing value
