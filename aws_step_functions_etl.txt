Orchestrate multiple ETL jobs using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/orchestrate-multiple-etl-jobs-using-aws-step-functions-and-aws-lambda/

what are the pain points step functions address?
no single visual representation of ETL workflow
tracing the overall workflow status
handling error scenarios

step functions
web service
coordiante components using visual workflows
build apps from individual components 
each component performs a discret function = task
can stitch together different tasks to apply to multiple applications quickly 
DRY 

example ETL workflow 
process sales dataset (PSD) - read in sales data, group by, transform, write output to parquet S3
process marketing dataset (PMD) - read marketing dataset, transform, write output to parquet S3
join marketing + sales datasets (JMSD) - read the parquet S3 files, perform inner join, sort, write to S3

timing
sales + marketing data sets are uploaded to S3 at random times 
PSD job should start as soon as Sales dataset file is uploaded
PMD job should start as soon as Marketing dataset file is uploaded 
parallel ETL jobs can start and finish anytime 
final JMSD job can only start after parallel PSD and PMD jobs are complete

main flow starts with AWS step functions state machine
state machine defines the steps 
can trigger the state machine many ways
AWS lambda functions = ETL runners 
ETL runners are invoked by activity tasks in the Step Functions
ETL runners need to periodically poll the step function state machine for tasks 
the state machien responds by providing a task object
the task object contains inputs for the ETL runner to run the ETL job
ETL runner maintains state of active jobs in DDB table
periodically the ETL runner checks the status of active jobs
when an active ETL job completes, the ETL runner notifies state machine 
this allows ETL workflow to move to the next step

Starting a State Machine Execution in Response to Amazon S3 Events
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-cloudwatch-events-s3.html
use EventBridge to execute Step Function state machine in response to S3 events (can also put on schedule)
configure state machine as target of EventBridge 

Use CDK solution to trigger state machine
