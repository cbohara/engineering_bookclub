Intro

CAP theorem - only get 2 out of 3
consistency - ensuring all systems produce the same response
availability - ensuring that every request receives a response
partition tolerance - ensuring that the system can survive the loss of a partition - must have in distributed systems

CA - consistency + availability - possible on a single system but not realistic
AP - available + partition tolerance - distributed nonrelational database systems - how do we recover without consistency after node failures?
CP - consistency + partition tolerance - sacrifice availablity for consistency - ex: financial data - easier to design
